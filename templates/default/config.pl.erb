# Configuration file for BackupPC.
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This is the main configuration file for BackupPC.
#
#   This file must be valid perl source, so make sure the punctuation,
#   quotes, and other syntax are valid.
#
#   This file is read by BackupPC at startup, when a HUP (-1) signal
#   is sent to BackupPC and also at each wakeup time whenever the
#   modification time of this file changes.
#
#   The configuration parameters are divided into four general groups.
#   The first group (general server configuration) provides general
#   configuration for BackupPC.  The next two groups describe what
#   to backup, when to do it, and how long to keep it.  The fourth
#   group are settings for the CGI http interface.
#
#   Configuration settings can also be specified on a per-PC basis.
#   Simply put the relevant settings in a config.pl file in the
#   PC's backup directory (ie: in __TOPDIR__/pc/hostName).
#   All configuration settings in the second, third and fourth
#   groups can be overridden by the per-PC config.pl file.
